# 🏈 Quarterback Clash

**Quarterback Clash** is a football-themed twist on the classic Pong game — built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. Instead of paddles and a plain ball, you’ll take control of **receiver gloves** to rally a **spiraling football** across the screen in a fast-paced, reflex-driven arcade challenge.

With dynamic gameplay, quirky cheat keys, a leaderboard, and even a **boss key** to hide your screen from supervisors, this game blends fun mechanics with tongue-in-cheek design.

## 🙌 Why I Built This Game
As a computer science student at the University of Manchester and a proud member of the UoM American Football Team (Defensive Line 🛡️), I wanted to combine my love for the game with my passion for programming.

Quarterback Clash started as a fun way to reimagine a classic like Pong — but it turned into a creative exercise in adding modern features like save/resume, persistent leaderboards, and even a cheeky boss key. This project helped me deepen my Python GUI and file handling skills while having a blast in the process.
